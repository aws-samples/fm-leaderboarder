## Introduction
There's no one-fit-all leaderboard. `FM-Leaderboard-er` will allow you to find the best LLM for your own business use case based on your own tasks, prompts, and data. 

## Features:
1. *Tasks* - Example notebooks for common tasks like Summarization, Classification, and RAG (coming soon).
2. *Models* -  Amazon Bedrock, OpenAI, any API (with a code integration).
3. *Metrics* - Built-in metrics per task + custom metrics (via a code integration).
4. *Latency* - Latency metric per model
5. *Cost* - comparison.
6. *Prompt* - You could compare several prompts across one model

## Getting Started
### Prerequisits
1. AWS account with Amazon Bedrock access to selected models.
2. Hugging Face access token
The code will download Dataset from Huggingface (```https://huggingface.co/api/datasets/Salesforce/dialogstudio```), this will require an access token, if you don't have one yet, follow these steps:

* Signup to Hugging Face: ```https://huggingface.co```
* Generate an access token (save it for further use): ```https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens```
* Store the access token localy, by installing python lib huggingface_hub and execute from shell:
    ```
    > pip install huggingface_hub
    > python -c "from huggingface_hub.hf_api import HfFolder; HfFolder.save_token('YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN')"
    ```


***(Verify you now have:  ```~/.cache/huggingface```)***

### Installation
